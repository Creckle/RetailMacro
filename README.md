Mouseover:
  Mouseover has a .5 sec timeout except on unit frames.
  That means you cannot perform consecutive actions on the target by keeping the pointer over it.
  
Focus and Mouseover:
  Focus and Mouseover are stored internally by name.
  This can lead to unpredictable behaviour in areas with NPCs who share the same name.
